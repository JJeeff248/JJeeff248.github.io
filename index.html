        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p> I'm a student at Victoria University of Wellington currently studying Computer Science and
            Data Science. </p>

        <p> I started programming in 2017 through school and have been using and learning it ever since. I really enjoy
            learning new things and I'm always looking to improve my skills. </p>
            
        <p> When I'm not coding, I'm usually playing video games, taking photos or just hanging out with my friends.
